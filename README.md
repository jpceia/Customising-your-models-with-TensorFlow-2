# Customising your models with TensorFlow 2

Repository with jupyter notebooks from the coursera course [Customising your models with TensorFlow 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/customising-models-tensorflow2)

## Syllabus

### Week 1 - The Keras functional API

TensorFlow offers multiple levels of API for constructing deep learning models, with varying levels of control and flexibility.

In this week you will learn to use the functional API for developing more flexible model architectures, including models with multiple inputs and outputs.
You will also learn about Tensors and Variables, as well as accessing and using inner layers within a model.
The programming assignment for this week will put these techniques this into practice with a transfer learning application on the dogs and cats image dataset.

### Week 2 - Data Pipeline

A flexible and efficient data pipeline is one of the most essential parts of deep learning model development.

In this week you will learn a powerful workflow for loading, processing, filtering and even augmenting data on the fly using tools from Keras and the tf.data module.
In the programming assignment for this week you will apply both sets of tools to implement a data pipeline for the LSUN and CIFAR-100 datasets.

### Week 3 - Sequence Modelling

Sequence modelling tasks represent a rich and interesting class of problems, ranging from natural language tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis, to forecasting of financial time series and speech audio generation.

In this week you will learn how to use the recurrent neural network API in TensorFlow, as well as several useful layer types and tools for processing sequence data.
In the programming assignment for this week, you will develop a generative language model on the Shakespeare dataset.

### Week 4 - Model subclassing and custom training loops

For more advanced use cases of TensorFlow, it is possible to obtain a low level of control over the design and behaviour of your deep learning model, as well as the training loop itself.

In this week you will learn how to exploit the Model and Layer subclassing API to develop fully flexible model architectures, as well as using the automatic differentiation tools in TensorFlow to implement custom training loops.
In the programming assignment for this week you will implement these custom model building tools to develop a deep residual network.

### Week 5 - Capstone Project

In this course you have learned a powerful set of tools for developing customised deep learning models, including for sequence data, and flexible data pipelines.

The Capstone Project brings many of these concepts together with a task to develop a custom neural translation model from English into German.
